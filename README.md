# Balls of Steel

Balls of steel (BOS) is an event-driven, hard-particles discrete particle method (DPM) simulator.
BoS aims to be a minimal, extremely fast but easily extendable version of an even-driven (ED) simulator.
It is currently in initial development.

## Instalation

Use cmake to create makefiles. Then just 'make'.

## Usage
Run as:

> ./bos 'config-file'

where config-file is expected to be a [DESDF](https://github.com/nicorivas/demdf) file.
